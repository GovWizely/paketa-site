				<h2>Combat Condition Testing</h2>
				<p>Paketa works with military groups inside of Ukraine to test Western technologies in combat conditions. Technology products accepted into the Paketa testing program receive a confidential report that details how your technology performed. Successful products advance into the Ukraine Ministry of Defense ecosystem.  
				<p>Ukraine wants new technologies to help fight Russia's War of Aggression as fast as possible. This is not a years long procurement process. <b>This is not a drill.</b>

				<h2>Reselling Ukraine Technology</h2>
				<p>We provide a next-generation ecosystem of AI-powered unmanned drones—air, ground, and marine—designed to operate in complex, high-risk environments. With built-in resistance to electronic warfare and real-time autonomous decision-making, our systems offer advanced reliability and performance where it matters most.</p>

				<h2>Frontline Feedback</h2>
			<p>Ukraine has proven that implementing Silicon Valley software development practices holds true for modern warfare. By allowing front line warriors to communicate directly with softare developers, the pace of innovation has eclipsed the outdated development processes of the West. This is the core tenant of <b>DevWar</b>. 
			<p>Paketa helps militaries outside of Ukraine develop processes and procedures needed to make DevWar a reality. This includes but is not limited to: capturing secure feedback from the front line warriors, delivering the feedback to the engineers, the CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery) processes for the field of battle. 					</div>

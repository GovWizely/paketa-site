				<h2>DevWar -- Are you ready?</h2>
				<p>Ukraine’s Warrior-to-Developer feedback loop (DevWar) has redefined modern warfare. Real-time collaboration between fighters and engineers has enabled rapid iteration and the deployment of more resilient technologies. While this innovation emerged organically in Ukraine, nations must now adapt DevWar into their processes and supply chains or risk falling behind. As one Ukraine drone operator bluntly stated, “Drones from the West fail on the field of battle.”
